I am a software engineer at [TIER IV](https://tier4.jp/en/), focusing on the research and development of autonomous driving systems and their various related components.

In March 2023, I completed my masters degree at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, advised by [Prof. Manabu Tsukada](https://tlab.hongo.wide.ad.jp/People/manabu-tsukada/) and [Prof. Hiroshi Esaki](http://hiroshi1.hongo.wide.ad.jp/hiroshi/). My research interests focused on Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) and V2X technologies.

I was previously a member of the [Esaki Laboratory](http://www.hongo.wide.ad.jp/index.html) and the [Tsukada Laboratory](https://tlab.hongo.wide.ad.jp/).

I have also been part of the [WIDE Project](https://www.wide.ad.jp/) and the [Industrial Cyber Security Center of Excellence (ICS CoE)](https://www.ipa.go.jp/icscoe/english/index.html).

My recent interests revolve around cooperative perception of connected vehicles and its integration into the open-source Autonomous Driving Stack [Autoware](https://tier4.jp/en/autoware/).
